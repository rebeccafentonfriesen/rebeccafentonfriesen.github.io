      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Becca, a Mechanical Engineering PhD student working with Northwestern&amp;rsquo;s Surface Haptics research group. I currently work with variable friction displays, looking both at the underlying mechanisms of how to manipulate friction as well as how to use this technology to create compelling haptic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my latest degree is in engineering, I spent several years pre-PhD working with neuroscientists on Brain Machine Interfaces. Observing the crippling consequences of lack of proprioceptive and tactile feedback during supposedly simple motor tasks informs and motivates my work today.&lt;/p&gt;
